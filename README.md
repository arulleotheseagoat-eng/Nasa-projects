# Nasa-projects
This project leverages NASAâ€™s Near-Earth Object (NEO) API to collect, clean, and analyze data on asteroids that closely approach Earth. The objective is to transform raw JSON data from NASA into structured SQL tables and deliver interactive insights via a Streamlit dashboard.  Users can explore asteroid velocity, size, proximity, and hazard
